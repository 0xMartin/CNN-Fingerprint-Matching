# 📘 CNN-Fingerprint-Matching

This repository contains a project for fingerprint matching using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project leverages a custom dataset and TensorFlow to train a model that can accurately identify fingerprint images.

## 🚀 Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple scripts and folders, handling various stages of the machine learning pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 📂 Code

The main code includes scripts for:
- Reading and preprocessing fingerprint images.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Defining and training the CNN model.
- Evaluating the model's performance.

```python
# Example code snippet
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(3, 3),
    ...
])
```

## 📊 Data

The data folder contains the FVC2002 fingerprint dataset, used for training and testing the model. This includes images processed and labeled based on fingerprint characteristics.

## 🔍 Model Overview

The CNN model used in this project includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, tailored to recognize patterns in fingerprint images effectively.

```python
model = keras.Sequential()

model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1), input_shape=(300, 300, 1)))
model.add(layers.Activation('relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2)))

model.add(layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1)))
model.add(layers.Activation('relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2)))

model.add(layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), strides=(1, 1)))
model.add(layers.Activation('relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2)))

model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(2048))
model.add(layers.Activation('relu'))

model.add(layers.Dense(num_classes))
model.add(layers.Activation('softmax'))

model.summary()

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## 🌐 Model Training

Training involves 30 epochs where the model learns to minimize loss and improve accuracy over time.

## 🖼️ Example Outputs
